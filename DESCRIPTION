Description: Provides R bindings for Google's s2 library for geometric calculations on
    the sphere. High-performance constructors and exporters provide high compatibility
    with existing spatial packages, transformers construct new geometries from existing
    geometries, predicates provide a means to select geometries based on spatial
    relationships, and accessors extract information about geometries.
